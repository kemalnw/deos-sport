# Deos Sport API (Project Showcase)

This repository is an archive of the **Deos Sport API**, a backend project I developed in 2020.  
It serves as a personal portfolio showcase to demonstrate how I approached project structure, tooling, and environment setup at the time.

> ðŸ“¦ This is a **showcase project**, not actively maintained. The codebase reflects my practices and experience during the period it was built.
